			<p>Electricians working with space programs are like the omnivores of Earth. You can find them both on a space shuttle and with Mission control. In mission to mars, they would be vital components, providing the backbone needed to create the complex electrical circuits needed on a space shuttle and an extraterrestrial shelter, but also as part of the team that inhabits that space, fixing any problems that might arise. Without them on board, any problems with the intricate parts of the missions electronics could turn deadly in a moment.</p>
			<p>As part of the a support team, and electricians job would mostly be to work with others in his/her field to create the life-support, scientific, and other necessary systems that astronauts and martian explorers would vitally need. If one was part of an actual journey to the red planet, they would likely be trained to perform many of the other duties that an astronaut would need to perform, such as enacting scientific experiments and keeping the shuttle/shelter up and running.</p>
			<p>To get a job for NASA, experts from NASA itself recommend training as part of a degree in another related field, such as a technician or repairer. It's also a good idea to spend several years working for a large company (i.e. Dominion, IBM, General Electric). If you prefer a path outside of the corporate world, jobs in the military for electricians are abundant, and can confer prestige and add a certain level of strength to any potential. In addition, jobs with companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing have the benefits of being military-related, while still being a corporate entity.</p>
