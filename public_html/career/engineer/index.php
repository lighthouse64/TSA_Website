			<p>Aerospace Engineers are a crucial part of any mission to another planet. Like chemists and physicists, they don't need to actually be on any of the spacecraft, but rather in the control room, ready to remedy problems as they arise. Their job is to design some of the most important tools of any inter-planetary exploration: The space ship itself, the suits the astronauts use, and all of the other odds and ends that you use on any space mission. The thing is, they have to design everything with a unique concept: it has to be able to		withstand the harsh conditions of the red planet.</p>
			<p>Most engineers that work with NASA or other space companies typically have at least a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering, and some have far beyond that. As with most space-related jobs, high grades, internships, are important things to have in a potential employment opportunity. Unfortunately, this field is slowly declining, at a rate of around 2% a year. However, the average payout of $51.84 and hour ($107,830 a year) compensates for that.</p>
			<p>It's highly recommend that if you want to work for NASA, you should start out in a private company. Most aerospace engineers aren't actually employed in space-related companies such as SpaceX or Mars one, but in private aeronautics companies like Boeing or Lockheed Martin. There main job relies in designing aircraft for the companies themselves to produce, or for the government to manufacture for potential conflicts. These companies are what most aerospace engineers do if they aren't employed in NASA or another space-related company.</p>
