		<p>In order to gain a deeper understanding of the current situation on the privatization and exploration of Mars, as well as the rest of space, we contacted and interviewed two experts in the field of space exploration. We asked them the following questions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Why do you believe it is important to reach mars?</li>
			<li>What will people do once they reach Mars?</li>
			<li>What about Mars interests you?</li>
			<li>How do you believe living on Mars will affect astronauts?</li>
			<li>How do you plan to supply the crew?</li>
			<li>What type of training will be required to explore Mars?</li>
			<li>How will you prepare for accidents that could occur on Mars?</li>
			<li>How do you believe colinization of Mars will affect its environment?</li>
			<li>How will the exploration of Mars benefit society?</li>
